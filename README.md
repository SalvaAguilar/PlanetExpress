PlanetExpress
=================

PlanetExpress

This android project is a simple application that organizes the packaging service of an
invented delivery company. The application communicates with a rest server through a transparent manager, and manipulates the data in background threads to finally update the UI.
It is a sample project that shows the flexibility of Dagger when applying on auxiliar and third party libraries.

The app uses some libraries: Gson and Android Asynchronous Http Client, and Square Dagger
